TODO:

- handle endpoints for multicasts correctly. Especially, delete them if they are no longer needed.
  This should probably be done as part of the redesign of the endpoints.
  
- implement "Zugverfahren". The so-called "Zugverfahren" allows to specify debouncing times and
  maximum retention times for SOME/IP communication channels, defined by their SOME/IP service
  identifier, SOME/IP method identifier, client instance and service instance. The "Zugverfahren"
  is implemented on server-side.

- define an interface between the vsomeip runtime and the vsomeip configuration. The goal is to
  enable configuration to be done by a configuration file (default) or by an application specific
  (probably generated) code module.  

- update the EA model to match the current implementation

- create unit tests for serialization/deserialization, configuration, message exchange...

- measure runtimes for exchanging local messages / UDP messages / TCP message
